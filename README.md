# Image Encryption Project

## Overview
This GitHub project implements three image encryption algorithms inspired by research papers. The algorithms leverage principles from the Josephus problem, filtering technology, chaotic maps, and row/column switching to achieve efficient and secure visual technology for protecting private images.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Josephus Problem and Filtering Diffusion Encryption
- The encryption algorithm utilizes the Josephus problem for pixel shuffling and filtering technology for diffusion.
- Classical diffusion and confusion structure is followed for enhanced security.
- Simulation results demonstrate uniform distribution in cipher images.
- The algorithm exhibits sensitivity to the secret key, resistance to various security attacks, and outperforms several advanced image encryption algorithms.

### 2. Josephus Traversing and Mixed Chaotic Map Encryption
- Similar to the first algorithm, this approach combines the Josephus problem and filtering technology.
- Follows classical diffusion and confusion structure for image encryption.
- Simulation results show encryption capabilities for various image types with uniform distribution.
- Security analysis indicates sensitivity to the secret key, resistance to security attacks, and superior performance compared to advanced image encryption algorithms.

### 3. Fast Image Algorithm Based on Rows and Columns Switch
- Proposes a fast image encryption algorithm based on rows and columns switch.
- Shuffling involves rows and columns, with simultaneous encryption of pixels using a key.
- Utilizes a logistic map to generate keys and switched indexes, reducing the iteration count for faster execution.
- Demonstrates significantly faster speed compared to other algorithms based on research data.
- Shows resilience against differential attacks, statistical analysis, known-plaintext, and chosen-plaintext attacks.
